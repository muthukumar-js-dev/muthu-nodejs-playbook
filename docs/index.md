## What Makes This Different

This playbook exists to bridge the gap between knowing Node.js syntax and understanding how to build production-grade systems.

### Not a Tutorial
No copy-paste examples or "getting started" guides. This assumes you already know JavaScript and basic Node.js.

### Not Framework Documentation
Learn underlying concepts that make you effective with any framework, not just Express or NestJS.

### Production Reality
Every concept is grounded in real production scenarios, failure modes, and architectural trade-offs.

## Who This Is For

- **Mid to Senior Engineers** looking to deepen their Node.js expertise
- **Interview Preparation** for system design and senior backend roles
- **Architects** making decisions about Node.js in production systems
- **Anyone** who wants to understand the "why" behind best practices
