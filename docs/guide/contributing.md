# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Node.js Production Playbook!

For complete contribution guidelines, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/muthukumar-js-dev/muthu-nodejs-playbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the repository.

## Quick Overview

### What We're Looking For

- **Technical corrections**: Fix inaccuracies or outdated information
- **Production scenarios**: Add real-world examples and failure modes
- **Better diagrams**: Improve visualizations and mental models
- **Clarifications**: Make complex concepts easier to understand

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Beginner tutorials or "getting started" guides
- Framework-specific documentation
- Copy-paste code snippets without explanation
- Theoretical concepts without production relevance

## Contribution Philosophy

All contributions must align with:

1. **Production-focused**: Real scenarios, not toy examples
2. **Mental model building**: Help readers build intuition
3. **Depth over breadth**: Thorough explanation of one concept
4. **Clarity**: Professional but approachable language

### For New Topics

1. Propose via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/muthukumar-js-dev/muthu-nodejs-playbook/issues)
2. Explain why the topic is needed
3. Show how it fits the repository structure
4. Wait for approval before writing

## Content Structure

Every topic must follow this structure:

1. **Why This Exists** - Real-world problem
2. **Mental Model** - Build imagination
3. **Internal Implementation** - Technical details
4. **Multiple Diagrams** - At least 4 Mermaid diagrams
5. **Production Use Cases** - Where to apply
6. **Anti-Patterns** - When NOT to use
7. **Failure Modes** - What breaks and why
8. **Trade-offs** - Decision frameworks

## Review Process

1. **Technical accuracy**: Is the information correct?
2. **Production relevance**: Does this reflect real systems?
3. **Clarity**: Can a mid-level engineer understand?
4. **Depth**: Does this go beyond documentation?
5. **Structure**: Does it follow the required format?
