# Getting Started

Welcome to the Node.js Production Playbook! This guide will help you get the most out of this resource.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- **JavaScript fundamentals**: Comfortable with ES6+ syntax, closures, promises, async/await
- **Basic Node.js usage**: You've built at least a few Node.js applications
- **Backend concepts**: Familiarity with REST APIs, databases, HTTP protocol

You do NOT need a computer science degree or advanced mathematics.

## How to Use This Playbook

### 1. Start with Fundamentals

Begin with [Section 1: Node.js Internals](/sections/01-nodejs-internals/01-nodejs-architecture). Understanding how Node.js works under the hood is crucial for everything else.

### 2. Read Sequentially

Topics build on each other. While you can jump around, sequential reading provides the best learning experience.

### 3. Read Slowly and Reflectively

These aren't tutorials to skim. Each topic is comprehensive and designed to change how you think about systems.

### 4. Study the Diagrams

Diagrams aren't decorative—they represent mental models. Try to reproduce them from memory to test your understanding.

### 5. Focus on "Why" and "When NOT to Use"

Understanding limitations is as important as understanding capabilities. Pay special attention to:
- Failure modes
- Trade-offs
- Anti-patterns
- When NOT to use a pattern

## Reading Structure

Each topic follows this format:

1. **Real-world problem** - Why this concept matters
2. **Mental model** - How to think about it
3. **Internal implementation** - How it actually works
4. **Diagrams** - Visual representations
5. **Production use cases** - Where to apply it
6. **Anti-patterns** - When NOT to use it
7. **Failure modes** - What breaks and why
8. **Trade-offs** - Decision frameworks

## Using the Search

Use the search bar (top right) to find specific topics. Search works across all content, including code examples and diagrams.

## When to Revisit

- **Before interviews**: Review system design and architecture topics
- **Starting new projects**: Read relevant architectural patterns
- **Production incidents**: Consult failure modes and debugging topics
- **Mentoring others**: Use explanations as teaching frameworks
