## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in the playbook content (e.g., a code example that introduces a security risk) or in the repository configuration:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2. Email the maintainer directly at [muthu@example.com] or report via [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/muthukumar-js-dev/muthu-nodejs-playbook/security/advisories/new) if enabled.
3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.

### Content Security Issues

Since this is an educational resource, "vulnerabilities" usually mean:
- Insecure code examples without proper warning
- Recommendations that are no longer considered secure
- Outdated security advice

We take these seriously as they can mislead engineers. Please report them and we will prioritize fixing the content.

### Infrastructure Issues

If you find issues with our GitHub Actions workflows, dependencies, or documentation site configuration, please report them privately.
